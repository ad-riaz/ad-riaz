## Hello everyone 👋
My name is Alex.  
**I am looking for a job as a junior Java developer.**  
I open to learning new technologies and getting deeper knowledge in backend development.

## ⚡ Experience
I have been studying Radiophysics for the last ten years and got the PhD in Physics. At the same time I was doing some programming stuff at university. During this time
- I worked on several simple projects as a frontend developer,
- created and maintained several websites,
- I've improved skills in HTML, CSS/SCSS, JS, Drupal,
- wrote code for several technical projects for my diploma, 
- did system administration at the department at my university,
- being involved in the organization of the annual scientific conference.

And I liked it. So I realized that I want to connect my future work with coding. I started to study backend development and completed two courses in 2021–2022:
- **Netcracker "Software Development (Java)" course**  
	In this course, I was involved in creation of an Android application for cycling touring. You can see the result at the [link](https://github.com/nc-bikepacker).
- **Neoflex "Development of applications and integration solutions for the financial market sector (Java)" course**  
	In this course, I developed a bank account management application. The code for the application can be found [here](https://github.com/edu-neoflex-bank).

- 👨‍💻 Java 
- ⚙️ Spring Boot, Spring MVC, Spring Data, Hibernate
- 👓 OOP, REST API, Git
- 🐧 Linux
